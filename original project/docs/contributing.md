## 🧩 How to Contribute a New Module

1. **Create a new folder** inside `modules/your_module_name`

2. Include:

   * `your_module.py` — Python logic class (can expose multiple methods)
   * `module.yaml` — metadata for methods and inputs
   * `usage_reference.yaml` — real examples for the CLI and docs
   * `templates/` — if needed for file rendering

3. Follow this return format in all methods:

```python
return {
  "status": "ok",  # or "fail", "warn"
  "message": "What happened",
  "data": {...}    # Optional: any output to use later
}
```

4. Validate your module using:

```bash
sawectl validate-module modules-community/your_module
```

## 🛠 Workflow Contributions

* Place new workflows in `workflows/community/`
* Use the full DSL: `trigger`, `steps`, `context_variables`, etc.
* Add an inline comment or short doc block explaining the use case

Validate with:

```bash
sawectl validate-workflow workflows/community/my_workflow.yaml
```

---

## 📝 Documentation Contributions

* Add or edit Markdown files in `/docs`
* Follow existing tone: practical, clear, developer-friendly
* Prefer examples and real-world use over theoretical explanations

## 🚦 Contribution Standards

| Aspect     | Rule                                                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code style | Follow existing formatting; keep it clean and readable     |
| Logging    | Use `commons.logs.get_logger()` with descriptive messages  |
| Comments   | Use only when necessary — code should be mostly self-clear |
| Secrets    | Never commit credentials, tokens, or real keys             |
| Testing    | Manual runs are fine; validate workflows with `sawectl`    |
